2019 Machine Learning Practice
==============================

This repository shows machine learning algorithm code using Python and Numpy.

1. MNIST eigen decomposition

	* Using only python3.6 and Numpy library.
	* You can see how to download MNIST dataset and caculate eigen decomposition using NUMPY.
	* Also cas see eigenvector image.

2. Apply MNIST to KNN algorithm
	
	* how to implement KNN algorithm using only numpy.
	* apply to MNIST dataset and calculate accuracy.
